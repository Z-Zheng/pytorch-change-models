Changen2 Model Package

This package contains the Changen2 model implementation for multi-temporal 
remote sensing image generation and change detection.

Main components:
- Changen2Config: Configuration class for Changen2 models
- Changen2Model: Base Changen2 model
- Changen2ForImageGeneration: Changen2 model for image generation tasks
- Changen2ForChangeDetection: Changen2 model for change detection tasks
- RSDiT: Resolution-Scalable Diffusion Transformer
- ChangeEventSimulation: Utilities for simulating change events
