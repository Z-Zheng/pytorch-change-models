## torchange - A Unified Change Representation Learning Benchmark Library
[![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/torchange)](https://pepy.tech/projects/torchange)

torchange aims to provide out-of-box contemporary spatiotemporal change model implementations, standard metrics, and datasets, in pursuit of benchmarking and reproducibility. 

>This project is still under development. Other repositories would be gradually merged into ```torchange```.

> The ```torchange``` API is in beta and may change in the near future.

> Note: ```torchange``` is designed to provide straightforward implementations, thus we will adopt a single file for each algorithm without any modular encapsulation.
Algorithms released before 2024 will be transferred here from our internal codebase.
If you encounter any bugs, please report them in the issue section. Please be patient with new releases and bug fixes, as this is a significant burden for a single maintainer. 
Technical consultations are only accepted via email inquiry.

> Our default training engine is [ever](https://github.com/Z-Zheng/ever/). 

### News

- 2024/06, we launch the project of ``torchange``.

### Features
