Abstract: Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the Earth's surface has been significantly advanced by deep vision models, which often require a massive amount of labeled multi-temporal images for training.
However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive.
In this paper, we present scalable multi-temporal change data generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic, alleviating these data problems. 
Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time.
We describe the stochastic change process as a probabilistic graphical model, namely the generative probabilistic change model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., condition-level change event simulation and image-level semantic change synthesis. 
To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a GPCM implemented with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time series of remote sensing images and corresponding semantic and change labels from labeled and even unlabeled single-temporal images.
Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and is capable of producing change supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images.
Unlike existing foundation models, our generative change foundation model synthesizes change data to train task-specific foundation models for change detection.
The resulting model possesses inherent zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability. 
Comprehensive experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability in data generation, e.g., Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time series of any length and resolutions of 1,024^2 pixels.
Changen2 pre-trained models exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to 3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to fully supervised counterpart) and transferability across multiple types of change tasks, including ordinary and off-nadir building change, land-use/land-cover change, and disaster assessment.

### Changen2 pre-trained ChangeStar (1x256) models
We provide the ChangeStar (1x256) architecture along with several pre-trained models, available for both further research and direct application.

See this [notebook](https://github.com/Z-Zheng/pytorch-change-models/blob/main/examples/changen2_pretrained_changestar1x256_inference_demo.ipynb) demo for model inference.

```python
from torchange.models.changestar_1xd import ChangeStar1xd
from torchange.models.changen2 import changestar_1x256

# zero-shot building change detection models
from torchange.models.changen2 import s1_init_s1c1_changestar_vitb_1x256

# zero-shot semantic (land use/land cover) change detection model
from torchange.models.changen2 import s9_init_s9c1_changestar_vitb_1x256

# zero-shot class-agnostic change detection model
# also can be used as a pre-trained startpoint for binary change detection models
from torchange.models.changen2 import s0_init_s1c1_changestar_vitb_1x256

# The two below load the above pre-trained weights and can only be used as pre-trained startpoint.
from torchange.models.changen2 import s0_init_s1c5_changestar_vitb_1x256
from torchange.models.changen2 import s0_init_s9c1_changestar_vitb_1x256

# This one was fine-tuned on xView2 dataset, see Table 6 in our paper for model performance
from torchange.models.changen2 import s0_init_xView2_ft_s1c5_changestar_vitb_1x256

# alias for s0_init_xView2_ft_s1c5_changestar_vitb_1x256
# providing an out-of-box building damage assessment model
